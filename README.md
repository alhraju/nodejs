 Let us think about a general “FTP Server” that will be used for an Internet Service
Provider (ISP). Normally, the ISP‟s try to facilitate their users by ftp servers, where
several media contents are present to fulfill customer‟s needs. The required features
are: -
 The system will have three types of users- ADMIN, MODERATOR,
MEMBER (generally service users)
 There must be a registration page for ADMIN and MODERATOR.
 Only valid users will get detailed access to the ftp server.
 Keep in mind; general users, means MEMEBRs need not to be registered. The
internet service users will get access to browse and download contents from
the ftp site.
 The ADMIN will be the main control point of the system. The ADMIN can
add or delete any MODERATOR. The ADMIN also can upload or delete
contents.
 The MODERATOR can only add or delete media contents and view all
uploaded contents.
 Provide functionalities for MODERATOR so that he can add new contents or
delete existing one‟s after login. This can be controlled on a separate page for
MODERATOR.
 There should be a profile page for MODERATOR and ADMIN.
 There must be a general home page from where navigation to other pages will
occur. Some highlighted contents will be shown here.
 In the site there will be several categories of media contents like Movies,
Software‟s, TV series, Games etc. All these categories will be shown in a tab
from where users will be able to navigate to their desired page.
 Under some category there may be sub-category. For example, under movie
section there may be different genre‟s movie. So, the division and subdivision
should be properly maintained.
 Contents will be shown to users as per the interaction. For example, if the user
has clicked on TV Series category it will show him/her all contents of that
category and if English sub-category is selected results will be shown as
filtered by the selection.
 There must be a search box in the home page from where MEMBERs will be
able to search directly for contents.
 There should be a request box where the MEMBERs will be able to make
content request. It must be placed on the home page.
 Both the MODERATOR and ADMIN can view the request box.
